# a quiz
This is more a way for me to practise my coding and problem-solving skills. The quiz is taken from the book "Metamagical Themas" by Dr. Hofstadter. The quiz is as follow:

"In this sentence, the number of occurences of 0 is ..., of 1 is ..., of 2 is ..., of 3 is ..., of 4 is ..., of 5 is ..., of 6 is ..., of 7 is ..., of 8 is ..., of 9 is ..."
