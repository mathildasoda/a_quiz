# a quiz
This is more a way for me to practise my coding and problem-solving skills. The quiz is taken from the book "Metamagical Themas" by Dr. Hofstadter. The quiz is as follow:

"In this sentence, the number of occurences of 0 is ..., of 1 is ..., of 2 is ..., of 3 is ..., of 4 is ..., of 5 is ..., of 6 is ..., of 7 is ..., of 8 is ..., of 9 is ..."

-_By: Raphael Robinson_

What I'm trying to find is the digits that would fit in the different "..."

I personally have not looked at the answer nor any people's attempts to solve the problem.
